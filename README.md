# K1WifiGateway

Program for using ESP8266 to hack a certain 6LoWPAN to WiFi bridge system to use O-MI.
Data is sniffed from a serial connection.

This program creates Open Messaging Interface write requests to following paths:
* Objects/K1/Gateways/<mac address> : Information about this hacking program
* Objects/K1/<room name> : Received sensor information from sensor box installed at room name


Installation to an ESP8266
--------------------------


### Getting a certificate and private key

Certificate and key need to be in unencrypted (empty passphrase) DER format.

Example for making keys:
generate the private key (a 1024 bit key is used in this example)

`> openssl genrsa -out my_private_key.pem 1024`

convert the private key into DER format

`> openssl rsa -in ./my_private_key.pem -out ./my_private_key -outform DER`

generate the certificate request using the previously generated private key

`> openssl req -new -key my_private_key.pem -out my_cert_req.pem`

get the certificate from Certificate Authority
(see other guides if you are managing your own CA)

convert the certificate into DER format 

`> openssl x509 -in my_cert.pem -out my_cert -outform DER`

Then you can use SPIFFS or convert the keys to C code header with

`> xxd -i client.crt > MyCertificates.h`

`> xxd -i client.key >> MyCertificates.h`

### Compiling

1. Install the [Arduino for ESP8266](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)
2. Depending on installation type, fix the `ESP_ROOT` in `./Makefile` to point to your installation
   directory.
3. Depending on your target ESP8266 module, fix other settings in the top of the Makefile
4. `$ make`
5. `$ make upload` for uploading the program to ESP8266 connected to `UPLOAD_PORT`

### OTA update

This project supports OTA update from the target server via secure HTTPS. This program ensures by
default the identity of the server and sends its own client certificate to server for
authentication, so unknown users cannot steal our client certificate from the update image.

To update:
1. `$ make`
2. The image needs to be copied to the target HTTPS server from
   `/tmp/KMEG-WSN-OMI-bridge/KMEG-WSN-OMI-bridge.bin`
3. The WHOLE VERSION STRING is sent by the esp when looking for updates and can be compared to the
   new one
4. This program checks updates only on boot.
5. Check that the program updated and is not in a reboot loop (update shouldn't take more than 5
   mins)

The current server setup has the image on path `/opt/k1update/KMEG-WSN-OMI-bridge.bin` and requires
modifying and reloading the nginx site config.


Hardware setup
==============


SERIAL CONFIGURATION:
-------------------

Serial pin configuration can be changed in the Makefile. The default
configuration is below, NodeMCU pin name is in parens.

Description                     | Transmit(NodeMcu)| Receive(NodeMcu)
--------------------------------|------------------|------------------
`Serial`  UART0: Usb,           | GPIO 1  (TX)     | GPIO 3  (RX)
`-DSWAPSERIAL0` puts `Serial` to| GPIO 15 (D8)     | GPIO 13 (D7)
`Serial1` UART1: RX from flash  | GPIO 2  (D4)     |

Use Serial1 for debug transmission (it can only transmit) and Serial for
hacking the bridge.  Now GPIO 1 is not used but is connected to usb serial for
debugging, (not needed for production) Connection to wifi-bridge can now send
AT commands and receive everything TinyOs is sending but cannot communicate to
TinyOs MCU, which is not needed. Also everything sent is also echoed back.
NOTE: Not good, TX is High when not transmitting? => requires modifications to
the original bridge

```
USB Host        ESP8266               WizFi220        TinyOs MCU
USB RX <---+---< USB     TX >         < TX >----------> RX                
           |   < GPIO 15 TX >         > RX <-----+----< TX         
           `---< GPIO 2  TX >                    |  
               > GPIO 13 RX <--------------------Â´  
```

GATEWAY CONNECTIONS SUMMARY:
--------------------------

Header is the text marked row of islands next to WizFi220 chip.

1. `VCC` ESP <--> `VCC` header
1. `GND` ESP <--> `GND` header
1. `GPIO13` (D7) ESP <--> `TX` header

WizFi connection replacements:

1. `GPIO31` WizFI220 pin44: Cut before resistor (near MCU) and attach MCU side to `GND`
1. `EXT_nRESET` WizFI220 pin35: (It's the extra wire; no pcb trace) Cut and attach MCU side to `GND`

OTHER CONNECTIONS:
------------------

Table for ESP boot mode pin configurations. for restarting in case of crash

D8 GPIO15| D3 GPIO0 | D4 GPIO2 |Mode
---------|----------|----------|-----------------
0V       |0V        |3.3V      |Uart Bootloader
0V       |3.3V      |3.3V      |(RE)BOOT SKETCH, use this configuration
3.3V     |x         |x         |SDIO mode (not used for Arduino)

In other words, connect:

1. `GPIO15` (D8) <--> `GND`
1. `GPIO0` (D3) <--> `VCC`
1. `GPIO2` (D4) <--> `VCC`
